###  ‚ù£What our customer say about Bit Form

** Excellent Support ! **

> I‚Äôm using this free version of this plugin and faced an issue with database. After back and forth I shoot an email to their site‚Äôs contact page and the developer offered to solve the issue over Anydesk. The dev spent a few hours and we found out that it was a configuration issue of MySQL at my server and the issue was eventually resolved.Gonna buy their pro version as soon as I need their paid features.

> No need any coding for developing form
> There is best features like
> Webhooks
> Redirect page
> Payment gateway
> Integration
> Much more
> Thanks bitapps team
> by @statusword

** Flexible, Feature-rich Form Builder! ** 
> I had a chance to play around with multiple Form Builders, and so far Bit Form is my favorite. It is quickly becoming my go-to Form Builder due to the flexibility it has and the speed with which the Bit Form team is addressing issues. I encountered two issues when using the Form Builder, 1 with the icon display on my file attach and second, with the Captcha position. The developer fixed the issue within 24 hours of me reporting it. This is a pretty new Form Builder, but I can tell it may become popular very quickly. I haven‚Äôt explored the Zoho integration, which I think is one of its most popular aspects, but can‚Äôt wait to do that.
 by @dspmax

** Amazing **
> Amazing plugins thanks for making it with drag & drop functionality.
 by @learnwithmentor


** Unbelievable Support **

> What can I say, I had an issue with notification email and they solved it in a matter of minutes on a Sunday‚Ä¶Now that‚Äôs what I call fast and effective support, well done
