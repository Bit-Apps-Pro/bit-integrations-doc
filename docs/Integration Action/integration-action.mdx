## Overview

Bit Integrations have some options in every integration called **`Info`** **`Edit`** **`Timeline`** **`Clone`** **`Delete`**. Please follow the points below to know how these options work

**1. Info:**  You can see the Authorized process information. **E.g**., What were the Client ID and Secret for the authorization process.

**2. Edit:** You can edit the integration you have already set up. If you want to make some necessary changes, you can do it by editing the integration.

**3. Timeline:**  We have an option in every integration "Timeline," where you can check integration success or error status. Also, you can check the Response value to see Why it's giving the error.

**4. Clone:** You can Clone the integration you had already set up. Suppose you already set up an integration Contact Form 7 with Google Sheet. And now you want to Integrate with another sheet. If you Clone the integration, you can save some time without having to repeat the authorize process.

> **Note: This feature (Clone) is available in pro version**

**5. Delete:** If you don't need any integration that you set up, you can delete this integration by deleting this option.
