## Overview: {#overview}
**Responses** of the report manage submission data properly. Information gathered using a form needs to be presented for viewing. Once the form is successfully submitted, data will be added as a new row into the responses of the database when you hit the button of the form. We can easily `manage`,` delete`, `update`, `filter`, `clone`, and `duplicate` records.

The features are shown below:

✔ View:/Detail View

✔ Column Reorder

✔ Adjustable Column Width

✔ Delete, Edit and duplicate

✔ Column Visibility

✔ Export Data




### View:/Detail View {#viewdetail-view}
You can also view a maximum of `100 records` on a single page. You can go next and previous pages by a single click. To the bottom right corner of the response page there is a option for showing a specific number of records on each page. Moreover, you can also sort record. If you click on any specific record you will see the record details as popup details views to the left.

You can `delete`, `edit`, `update` or `duplicate` a specific record. You can also delete, duplicate and edit Bulk records.If you go to the very left of every specific record and click on three dots. You will find there the options will be available for delete, edit or duplicate. Suppose, you have two records with the same email = “test@test.com” so you can click on the record and delete the desired one. If you have 2000 records in your response and you want to delete them. For this you can select the multiple records together and click on the delete button to delete them together. This way you can delete all records from responses in a few attempts. You do not need to go through every record and delete them one by one.
