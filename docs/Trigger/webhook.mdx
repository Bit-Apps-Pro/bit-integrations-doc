   -	Paste the Webhook URL into the apps you want to get data from. The setup of this step will depend on the apps you are using, as each tool has a different interface for the webhook. Below is an example from **Bit Form**.

   -	The app from which you want to send data. From there, you will need to send a **test request**.
   -	If you successfully send a request, the data will be automatically **fetched**. Then the **set action** button will be activated. Next, click on the **`set action`** button.
