## Integration Settings:

5. After completing the authorization process, Select the ***FluentCRM list*** on the Fluent CRM field that you have created before on your CRM account. All your subscribers will be listed under this list. 

6. You can select multiple tags for the list on the ***FluentCRM Tags*** field. You have to create them earlier on the FluentCRM. Tags will help you to search the list & leads easily. 

7. Then, you have to map the form fields with ***FluentCRM*** fields. By default, the field is **Email**. You can select multiple fields from map field settings.

8.	There are two actions available you can trigger if you need any of them-
    - **Skip exist contact:** Enabling this option, you can skip duplicate email submission of the subscriber.
    - **Double Opt-in:** If this action is enabled, then the user will get a notification if they want to be a subscriber or not.
