> **Note: When you try integrating User Registration(Trigger) with Mailpoet, if you get an error "This subscriber already exists." <br/>  <br/> When a user creates in WordPress, MailPoet directly creates a Subscriber under the "WordPress Users" list. <br/> <br/> Stop this thing; according to mailPoet documentation, they said the "WordPress User" list moved to trash and disabled. Even when we move the list (WordPress User) to trash, it automatically adds the user.**
