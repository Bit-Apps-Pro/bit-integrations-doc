3. After that, To get the **Client Id & Client Secret**, click on `Azure Portal`. <br/> For client ID & secret you have to visit the **Azure Portal**. If you already have any Client ID & secret before then copy this to the field. If you don’t have any then you have to create a new client ID & secret, Register an App by clicking `New Registration`
    1. **Name:** In the name field, put the proper app name of your choice.
    2. **Supported account types:** Personal Microsoft accounts only
    3. **Redirect URI:** Select Web as a platform from the drop-down list. Copy the Redirect URIs from integrations settings and paste it under Redirect URI field. And click on the Register button.
