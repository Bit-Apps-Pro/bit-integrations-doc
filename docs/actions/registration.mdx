3.	For a successful full registration there are two types of notifications - `User Email Notification` & `Admin Email Notification`. Also, WP admin can set the **WP User Role**. And you can set `auto Login`, the user login automatically after registration.

4.	Additionally, you can add custom fields to personalize your users' profile. You can create custom fields. After creating custom fields, you have to map it with Trigger fields from the `User Meta Field Mapping`. For that you need the corresponding id of the custom field.
