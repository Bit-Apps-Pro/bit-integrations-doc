> **Note: Webhooks is available in the free and pro versions.**

When users submit/complete the form/task, you can send those data to webhook and send it to other platforms. We will use Konnectzit here to receive webhook data.

We are using Fluent Form as a trigger when someone submits the form, it sends data to Konnectzit and sends it to Google Sheets.

**To integrate with Web hooks follow, the below steps.**


1. Search & Select **Web hooks** from the actions pages
