3.	You can only create **Simple Product** & **Affiliate Product**. When you map all the form fields, you have to remember some **default values on WooCommerce** fields. So, you have to mention those values on the back end of the form builder. Which are:
    - Product status - pending, draft, publish, future, private & trash.

    - Product type - simple, external

    - Allow Backorders - no, notify, yes

    - Allow Reviews - open, closed

    - Virtual - yes, no

    - Manage Stock - yes, no

    - Sold Individually - yes, no

    - Downloadable - yes, no

:::info

 The values are case-sensitive, so make sure to give it the same value as all small letters.

4.	You can customize the product **categories** & **tags** according to your choice from integration. Also, you can use the default options here. All the categories will be **parent type**. 

:::tip

 If any of the category or tags already exist in your WoocCommerce, then it will be referenced to that particular category/tag, otherwise it will create a new one.

5.	If you select the downloadable product, then you have to add attachment file fields. For this, you have to map the form field from the `Map file upload fields` section which is **Downloadable Files**. And click on the Next button to move forward for further settings.
