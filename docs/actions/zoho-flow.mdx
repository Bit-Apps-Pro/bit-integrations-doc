> **Note: Zoho Flow is available in the free and pro versions.**


When users submit/complete the form/task, you can send those data to webhook and send it to other platforms. We will use Zoho Flow here to receive webhook data.

We are using user registration (create new user) as a trigger when someone register the website, it sends data to Zoho Flow and sends it to Google Sheets.


**To integrate with Zoho Flow follow, the below steps.**


1. Search & Select **Zoho Flow** from the actions pages

2. Integration Name: Set the proper integration name. Default it's taken “Web Hooks”.
  <Image src="actions/zoho-flow/integration-name" alt="Webhook" w="1020"  h="350" />

3.	Create the flow and configure the webhook. Select the payload format, then copy the incoming webhook URL from Zoho Flow. Next, navigate to the Integrations settings, and insert it into the link field. Select the POST option afterward.

5. To send all the data in the form. Select **Body** to send data requests on other platforms.
6. Check **Send All Data** if you want to send all information, or you can select the field of your choice. Select **application/json** from Add Request Payload option

10.	 At Bit Integrations, the **`Timeline`** of each integration contains a feature allowing you to quickly view the status of your integration, whether it has been successful or encountered an error.
